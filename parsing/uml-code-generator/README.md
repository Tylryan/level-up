# TODO
- [] Enhance: Allow for more types of arrows.
  - These arrows probably need to be housed under a union
  - Compositional Arrows: These classes/interfaces point to fields. These fields would need to be imported
  - Relational Arrows: Inheritence. These classes/interfaces would need to be added to the signature and imported
  - Other Arrows: All other arrows are to be ignored for now
- [] Fix: 'compositional' arrows are treated like relational arrows.
- [] --help

- [x] Add `package ...` to the tops of the files
- [x] User can specify their own file
